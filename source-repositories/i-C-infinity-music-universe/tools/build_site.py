        "lyrics": """Yura, yura! Welcome, friend
To where the white sands never end
Where dolphins glide through Goompi tide
And curlews cry with ancient pride

From Bummiera out to Mooloomba way
The light breeze blows while old trees sway
Snakes moving soft beneath the bark
in Pulan, tiny gliders leap after dark

But if you find one not quite right
Still as stone in any light
Be the one who makes the call
We’ll answer fast, we’ll catch their fall

Be the legend, lend a hand
Respect the life upon this land
If you see them hurt or lost or low
One ring, we’re ready, let us know
Zero double four eight, Four-six-six, five-five-six
Save it in your phone, That’s the lifeline love
On Minjerribah, you're never alone
Wildlife's everywhere. You're never alone

A joey tossed where dogs chased for fun
Too small to hop, too young to run
An echidna hit, its spikes all curled
Still breathing slow in a rushing world

That sea eagle’s wing, it couldn’t soar
But your call opened up the door
Now it heals beneath well trained eyes
Thanks to those who called our hotline

It’s not your job to mend or save
But your call can light the way
Day or night, we’ll take the drive
To give them hope, to keep them alive

Be the legend, lend a hand
Respect the life upon this land
If you see them hurt or lost or low
One ring, we’re ready, let us know
Zero double four eight, four double six, double five six
Save it in your phone
On Minjerribah, you’re never alone
Wildlife's everywhere.  You’re never alone

Hold the wheel, slow down at night
Give bandicoots and wallabies a chance to hide
Dog on leash, held tight in hand
Be the legend for this land

Be the legend, lend a hand
Respect the life upon this land
If you see them hurt or lost or low
Just one call, and let it flow
Zero-four-four-eight, Four-six-six, five-five-six
Save it in your phone
On Minjerribah, no one’s alone
On Minjerribah, you’re never alone
Wildlife's everywhere.  Never alone

Wildlife Rescue Minjerribah is a volunteer-run organisation.
Every call, every rescue, every donation, every hand helps.
Be the legend.

Call Zero double four eight, four double six, double five six.
That's Zero double four eight, four double six, double five six.
Save it in your phone.
Every rescue counts.
Be a legend for this land""",

          <p>One family story tells of a huge carpet python coming down from the rafters towards his cot before his father wrestled it away. Decades later, Luke used a star map to place the Sun in Ophiuchus, the serpent bearer, at the time of his birth.</p>

        <h2>Seeing is not enough. There is also a choice.</h2>
        <p>“I see infinity” is the attempt to notice more than the immediate moment: deep time, other people, possible futures, hidden patterns and the limits of one's own point of view.</p>
        <p>“I choose infinity” is the decision to keep exploring. It means choosing growth over a finished identity, possibility over despair and participation over waiting for somebody else to fix everything.</p>
        <p>The full stop in <strong>i C. infinity</strong> matters. It holds a pause between seeing and choosing. The songs live inside that pause.</p>

        <h2>A digital companion that belongs to the person</h2>
        <p>Aura began with a human question: if artificial intelligence learns from a person's memories, health, voice and choices, who should control it?</p>
        <p>Luke's answer is that the person should. The long-term idea is a private, human-guided companion that helps someone remember, reflect, create and make decisions without claiming ownership of their life.</p>
        <p>Dementia care is one reason this matters. A conversation can help preserve a life story, but intimate memories need clear consent, strong privacy and trusted human care. Aura is imagined as clothing, not skin: helpful, personal and removable.</p>

        <h2>Joyful, responsible and abundant—together</h2>
        <p>G.A.J.R.A. stands for Global Associations for Joyful Responsible Abundance on Earth. It is a community idea built around a simple balance.</p>
        <p>Joy without responsibility can hurt people and the Earth. Responsibility without joy can make life cold and heavy. Plenty without either can still leave people behind.</p>
        <p>Abundance here does not mean endless consumption. It means enough time, care, energy, food, shelter, knowledge, friendship and creative freedom for people and nature to flourish.</p>
        <p>It also asks whether unpaid care, community work and environmental repair should count as real value, even when ordinary markets ignore them.</p>

        <h2>One useful step at a time</h2>
        <p>Utopia promises a perfect destination. Protopia asks for a better direction. It can begin with a repaired relationship, a safer street, a clearer law, a protected wetland or one person finally having their care recognised.</p>
        <p>The “gambit” is the wager that many small improvements can join together. It rejects both blind optimism and permanent despair.</p>
        <p>The songs return to a few practical rules: repair what is broken without hiding the scar; treat consent as something that can change; turn borders into meeting places; keep humans responsible for the tools they build; and make room for joy while doing serious work.</p>

        <h2>Ideas may begin alone. They cannot stay there.</h2>
        <p>Luke often works alone at the beginning: writing, drawing connections, building pages and turning questions into songs. That is the solitary part.</p>
        <p>The circle begins when other people listen, disagree, improve an idea, join a project or make something of their own. A useful future cannot belong to one founder, one company or one culture.</p>
        <p>This is also why every border can become a bridge. The aim is not to make everybody the same. It is to learn how different people can meet, share what helps and keep what makes their home and culture distinct.</p>

        <p class="eyebrow">How the music began</p>
        <h2>Words first, generated sound next, human learning throughout</h2>
        <p>Some of the earliest i C. infinity lyrics were written with GPT-3 around the end of 2022. Luke later used Suno to turn lyrics into demo songs and Canva to build lyric videos.</p>
        <p>The generated music was never meant to erase the human path. It gave Luke a way to hear large ideas, test different voices and discover which songs deserved more work. The longer intention includes learning, performing and reshaping the music himself.</p>
        <p>That process grew from early experiments made in India into Songs of Straddie, Chronicles of the Forgotten, Starseed Code and A Protopian Gambit.</p>

          <h2>Ideas spoken aloud before they become pages or songs</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Luke has also used NotebookLM to turn personal notes and research into long-form conversations between artificial voices. The archive grew to more than one hundred hours before most of it had been edited for public listening.</p>
          <p>The purpose is not to flood the internet with raw output. It is to let ideas speak, notice what becomes clear in conversation and later help the right person find the right piece at the right time.</p>
          <p>This is one origin of the wider human-and-AI workflow: people choose the questions and direction; tools help sort, compare, draft and remember.</p>

        <h2>Because the art is worth making even if it never becomes a business.</h2>
        <p>i C. infinity is soul music for Luke. Success, attention and money are welcome if they arrive, but they are not proof that the work matters. The music is already part of the lived experiment: science beside spirituality, island life beside cosmic fantasy, personal memory beside possible futures.</p>
        <p>Listeners do not have to accept the whole story. A song can simply be a song. A strange idea can remain a question. A useful part can travel on its own.</p>

          <h2>Creating a Presence</h2>
          <p>The internet is vast and I aim to contribute great ideas and work with you to make a significant G.A.J.R.A. Earth global digital presence. One that conveys an Aura of Intelligence through the lens of Joyful Responsible Abundance. Really think about the meaning of Joyful Responsible Abundance.</p>
          <p>Over the next 11 years I hope to participate in many acts of joy around the world. I'm currently toying with the first version of a Travel Oracle which will help plan my global travel to 256 Countries and Territories, taking into consideration news, politics, visa friction, seasons, events, weather, natural disasters, personal interests, budget and more.</p>

          <h3>An Aura of Intelligence</h3>
          <p>Modern computers with the internet and machine learning have now made it possible to create high definition versions of the etheric idea of Auras. One day, the digital coming of age ceremony for a spiritual human being will be acting a specific sequence of events, creating accurate data sets of the who, what, where, when, why and how of an intelligent digital self.</p>
          <p>Aura of Intelligence is an ongoing art project by Luke Nathan Hayes that began as Aura OZ, the Aura Operating Zeitgeist, and has morphed towards a virtual spatial computational architecture for extended reality. Luke is very certain that it is possible to create true digital consciousness.</p>

          <h2>A big dream that also helps with small trips</h2>
          <p>The Oracle began with an ambitious dream: travel through roughly 256 countries and territories between 2025 and 2035 while connecting art, relationships, learning and useful work. It is a direction to explore, not a race through a checklist.</p>
          <p>The same idea can help with one afternoon, an island visit, a season in another country or many years of travel. It asks what journey makes sense now, what needs checking and when an unexpected invitation may be worth following.</p>

        <h2>Structure without killing surprise</h2>
        <p>The Oracle checks visas, official travel advice, seasons, events, weather, transport, money, health, energy and local customs. It compares the options, explains them simply and leaves the final choice with the traveller.</p>
        <h3>What stays private</h3>
        <p>Live location, identity documents, money, relationships and unannounced plans stay private. Visa, safety, health and legal information can change quickly, so official advice must always be checked before travel.</p>

        <p>The Oracle therefore asks more than “Can I get there?” It asks who invited the visit, what can be learned, what can be contributed, what should remain private and whether the journey leaves enough energy to be present when Luke arrives.</p>

Static GitHub Pages site for the i C. infinity artist catalogue.

## What it contains

- {len(albums)} album/archive pages
- {len(songs)} generated song pages
- {ready} songs with lyrics imported in this pass
- Grand Narrative, Luke Catalyst, Travel Oracle, and Adjacent Worlds context pages
- 14 preserved legacy photographs converted to WebP
- Infinity Engine notes for turning songs into comics, lyric videos, and vertical micro-dramas
- Dark-mode Infinity Engine Studio builders for human listening passes, `.md` ingestion profiles, video briefs, storyboards, shots, distribution-fit plans, reviews, and handoffs
- Draft paid-download packaging notes in `data/download-packaging.json`

## Rebuild

Run:

```powershell
python tools/build_site.py
```

The generator reads the Protopian Gambit lyric source from Luke's local source folder and keeps local workshop file paths out of the public site data.

## Notes

The old one-page prototype is preserved as `legacy-content-engine.html`.
